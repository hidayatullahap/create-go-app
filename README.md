I really like to try stuff with Go, so i create a lot of "Hello World". It feels so repetitive, inspired from create-react-app so I made this bash command to create simple hello world project generator.

How to use it

Clone it and give bash permission
```
$ git clone git@github.com:hidayatullahap/create-go-app.git
$ cd create-go-app
$ chmod +x main.sh
```

cd into path that you want to use then run main.sh with your project name
```
$ ./main.sh HelloWorld
```
